# NeuralStyleTransfer
A program for completing a neural style transfer for 2 arbitrary images

Note: This repository only contains the code files. The program expects folders (but does not create them at the moment) for storing and loading the pictures. These folders include:

1. 'content_images', this folder is for the inputted images that have the content that is wanted in the output image.
2. 'style_images/style_images_256', this folder is for the inputted style images.
3. 'generated_images', this is where the stylized images will be stored in.
